Data Science 

This repository contains a collection of my data science projects, where I used various machine learning techniques and Python programming to solve real-world problems.


Titanic Survival Prediction: The project included creating a program to predict which passengers survived the Titanic accident. I used attributes such as age, gender, and class to develop classification algorithms following data cleaning and feature engineering.


Movie Rating Prediction with python: I have developed machine learning which predict movie ratings based on genre, director, and cast. The emphasis was on data preprocessing, feature selection, and model performance optimization by experimentation with various approaches.


Iris Flower Classification: In this classic machine learning exercise, I sorted Iris flowers into species based on petal and sepal measures. This research demonstrated essential techniques in supervised learning and model evaluation.


Sales Prediction using python: I developed a model to forecast future sales trends based on historical data. To develop accurate sales estimates, this project required time series analysis, feature extraction, and the use of regression methods.


Credit Card Fraud Detection: In this research, I addressed the difficulty of detecting fraudulent transactions in a highly skewed dataset. I used techniques such as resampling and anomaly detection to improve the model's ability to detect fraudulent activities.
